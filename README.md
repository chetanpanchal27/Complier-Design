Compiler Design

A compiler translates the code written in one language to some other language without changing the meaning of the program. 
It is also expected that a compiler should make the target code efficient and optimized in terms of time and space. 
Compiler design principles provide an in-depth view of translation and optimization process. 
Compiler design covers basic translation mechanism and error detection & recovery.
It includes lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis as front end, and code generation and optimization as back-end.

So, here I have uploaded some of the programs related to compiler design to its better understanding.
